	Use  ESP32 + module
	BOM:
	MCU: ESP32-C3-MINI-1U
	Cellular + GNSS: SIM7080G
	HR/SpO₂ front-end: Cheap: MAX30102 (Maxim/AD)… PRO: MAX86176 + OSRAM SFH7072 LED
	Temperature: Cheap TMP117 (TI)… PRO: MAX30205 (on-skin) 
	IMU: Cheap LIS2DW12 (ST.. PRO: LSM6DSOX
	Charger: Cheap BQ24074 (TI)
	Cheap Buck: TPS62740 (TI) … PRO: BucknBoost: BQ24076 + TPS63810 buck-boost
	LTE antenna
	GNSS antenna
	Esim: ST4SIM-200M (ST)
	Haptics: 10 mm coin motor + side tactile switch + RGB LED
	Passives: 0402 passives, 2× u.FL, pogo/prog pads
	Lipo: flat cell 350–500 mAh
	
	100+ Unit: Cheap: 26.8 US dollar … PRO: 35 Dollar
	
	
	Interface. Maxim, tmp, imu I2C. Int for each system
	Interface sim7080G UART. Additional Io lines for reset ans stuff
	Esp32 already has antenna for ble and wifi 2.4Ghz
	Sim7080g need 2 separate antennas for LTE 700 - 2100Mhz, Gnss 1570MHZ
	 
	ESP32_C3_MINI_1. 
		GPIO 2 8 9 control boot mode
			Spi boot mode (run loaded program)  1 x(not matter) 1
			Joint download (usb or  uart)  1 1 0

		DOES NOT SEEM TO SUPPORT VOICE CALLING. SINCE MOST CARRIER DO NOT HAVE VoLTE
SEQ:
	MCU turn on by battery
	Strapping pin and push buttons for boot modes
	MCU turn on SIM7080G by PWRKEY -> turn on Shifter
	MCU turn on 1v8 LDO -> turn on MAX and IMU
	MCU communicate with SIM7080 through UART and SHifter
	MCU communicate with MAX and IMU through I2C
	Notes: INT signal from IMU, MAX -> MCU
		Antenna
			Use 2 Antenna for Cellular and GNSS
			Or 1 for both Cellular and GNSS
				Select by Ant_control pins
