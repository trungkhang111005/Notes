Snubber Circuit Using resistor and relay, or Mosfet for low power
Drones
	FC 
		Can be built with STM32 (open source fw)
		IMU
		GPS: has to buy a module (calculate position by using relative distance to satellite)
		Headers to communicate with ESC
	ESC
		MCU: stm32 also open source fw
		FOC or 6-trapezoidal
		DRV brushless driver
			External FETs
General
	IMUs: BMI088 or ICM-42688-P: no on board fusion but high rate, low drift, do filter on MCU
		Both ICs are less than $10
		Madgwick filter: 1 dimensional, gradient adjustment
		Mahony: PI complimentary (3 dimensional)
	FOC needs shunt resistor (current control)
		2-shunt. 3-shunt (2 phase sense vs 3 phase sense)
		DRV brushless driver DRV83xx (DRV8323)
		Link capacitor (between supply and before switching)
		Add DOB (disturbance observer for robustness)
			Need model of Motor joints (inertia)
		(FOC uses Clark-Park to transform 3-phase current to q and d vectors. 
			q is torque producing
	6 trapezoidal (votage control)
		Need voltage sense
Odrive:
	Needs Altium/software to convert to gerber
